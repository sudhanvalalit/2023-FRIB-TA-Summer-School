    "The purpose of this challenge is for you to calibrate the Liquid Drop Model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula and compare the results of a \"black box\" calibration vs a principled Bayesian one.\n",

    "- Import the data from the AME 2016 table (included in the github). We are only using nuclei above A=16 to avoid light nuclei where the LDM fails particularly. Perform a curve fit using the built in functions from python (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html) and take note of the reported uncertainties in the parameters. \n",
    "- Make a plot of the residuals and estimate the model error on its best fit. \n",
    "- Make a model calibration using the Bayesian formalism we defined and a Metropolis sampler. For the error, use your estimation from the previous point (the model error in this case is much smaller than the actual experimental uncertainties). \n",
    "- Plot the corner plot posterior as well as the model values on the Binding Energy per nucleon for the Calcium chain up to 60Ca including the available experimental data.\n",
    "- What would be the results if you have used in the calibration the Binding Energy per nucleon instead of the total Binding Energy?\n",
    "- Bonus: Find the experimental error in the masses and repeat the calibration using only experimental errors. This should give a good demonstration on the dangers of not taking into account model errors. \n"
